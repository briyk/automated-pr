### Automatic Suggestion Acceptance

This repository is configured to automatically handle PR suggestions:

1. **Auto-Approve Safe Changes**
   - Safe code improvements are automatically approved
   - Style and formatting suggestions are applied automatically
   - Non-breaking changes are accepted without manual review

2. **Suggestion Commands**
   ```bash
   # Accept all pending suggestions
   @qodo /accept-all
   
   # Accept specific suggestion
   @qodo /accept 123  # where 123 is the suggestion ID
   
   # Implement suggested changes
   @qodo /implement
   ```

3. **Safety Measures**
   - Only non-breaking changes are auto-approved
   - Security-sensitive changes require manual review
   - Complex refactoring suggestions need explicit approval

4. **Configuration**
   The auto-suggestion feature is controlled by:
   - `.pr_agent.toml` settings
   - Environment variables in the GitHub workflow
   - Per-PR override commands
